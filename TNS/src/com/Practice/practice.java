/*ABSTRACTION:-
 * Abstraction is  detailed hiding (implementation hiding) & showing main services or interfaces
 * e.g :- As in the car case,relevent parts like stearing,gear,horn,accelarator,breaks etc are shown to driver 
 * because they are necessary for driving .
 * but the driver need not known the internal functioning of engine, gear,etc. 
 * thus, showing relevent data to the user and hiding implementation or details from the user is Abstract
